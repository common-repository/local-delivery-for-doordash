Offer immediate and pre-scheduled local delivery to your WooCommerce shop customers with DoorDash’s integrated delivery solution.

== Description ==

With the Local Delivery by DoorDash plugin for WooCommerce, your store can offer convenient local delivery to customers right from within the shopping cart -- no app needed. Businesses of all sizes and across industries can use this plugin to tap into the same network of 1+ million monthly active Dashers that powers top retailers, grocery stores, restaurants, and thousands of other businesses around the US.

= How It Works =

As customers enter the shopping cart or checkout page, they are quoted a local delivery rate much like other standard shipping methods. The merchant collects the customer’s payment and then pays DoorDash directly for the fulfilled delivery, meaning the customer doesn’t need a DoorDash account or app. Both customers and merchants are able to track deliveries in real time.

Merchants **do not** need to be listed on DoorDash Marketplace (i.e., the DoorDash app or website) to use this plugin. However, all merchants must sign up for a free [DoorDash Developer account](https://developer.doordash.com/portal) to get API credentials and be approved to launch.

Setup is easy -- [click here for a step-by-step tutorial](https://developer.doordash.com/en-US/docs/drive/tutorials/get_started_woocommerce) and best practices for enabling delivery in your store.
